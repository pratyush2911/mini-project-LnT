Each book will have a unique identification number, also known as access number and other details including title, author and availability in library which will help to know about the book.
There could be more than one copy of a book and each copy is assigned a unique access number.
The system should be able to retrieve information like who took a particular book or what are the books checked-out by a specific library member.
There should be a maximum limit (5) on how many books a member can check-out.
The system should be able to tell if a book is beyond the duea date or not by retrieving the current date of the system.
Each book and member card will have a unique barcode. The system will be able to read barcodes from books and members’ library cards.


## Research
•	The number of students studying in a school or a university are much more than one can think of keeping a track of records for the students. Register based system to keep a track on books is still being used in some of the schools, but as the number of students as well the number of the books increase, it becomes difficult to manage the records.
•	Library Checkout is an efficient library management system in which a student can search the book by it's name to know whether it is available in the library or not, helps in creating an entry for the one who wants to issue a book as well as deletiion of that entry when the book being returned.
